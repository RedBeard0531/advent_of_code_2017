# Advent of Code 2017

These are my solutions to [advent of code](http://adventofcode.com/2017).
I'm doing it in [nim](https://nim-lang.org/features.html), since it is
both fun to write and really fast to run. Some days are also written in
other languages to compare.

I make no claim that any of this is good code...
